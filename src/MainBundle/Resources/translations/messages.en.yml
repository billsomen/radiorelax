      intro: I am a Freelance IT Engineer with High Management Skills
      desc_1: I’m bilingual, I learn fast, I have experience on backend development (Symfony, SQL, Heroku, …) and
        Project Management. I’m very professional and I improve myself every day.  I’ve been granted to Défi
        Montréal (CRIM)’s incubator to empower my personal project Edutools and to build the Vortex (an ERP
        for startupers).
